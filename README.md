This repository contains the code used for my masters thesis project.

Experiment One - Investigating the change in graphs' persistent homologies through the addition of a hub node

Experiment Two - Predicting the behaviour of a spread of an infection on a network using persistence diagrams

Experiment Three - Using MAPPER to reformat a graph into a smaller representation for decision making
